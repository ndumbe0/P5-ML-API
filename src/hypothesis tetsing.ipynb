    "Age is a significant factor: The strongest relationship found is between age and sepsis. This could have important implications for patient care and risk assessment.\n",
    "Blood pressure and insurance are not significant: Neither blood pressure nor insurance status showed a statistically significant relationship with sepsis in this analysis. However, this doesn't mean these factors are irrelevant; they might still play a role that wasn't captured by these specific tests or this particular dataset.\n",
    "Further investigation needed: While age shows a clear association with sepsis, the nature of this relationship (e.g., which age groups are more at risk) would require further analysis. For blood pressure and insurance, despite not showing significance here, it might be worth exploring these factors with different statistical methods or larger datasets.\n",
    "Clinical vs. Statistical Significance: Remember that statistical significance doesn't always equate to clinical significance. Even though blood pressure and insurance didn't show statistical significance, they might still be clinically important in sepsis management and prevention.\n",
    "Limitations: These results are based on the specific dataset and methods used. Other factors not considered here might also play important roles in sepsis occurrence and outcomes.\n",
    "These findings provide a starting point for understanding factors associated with sepsis in this patient population, with age emerging as a key factor to consider in sepsis risk assessment and management."
